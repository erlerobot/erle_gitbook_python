Just like in real life, sometimes we'd like our code to be able to make decisions.

The Python programs we've written so far have had one-track minds: they can add two numbers or print something, but they don't have the ability to pick one of these outcomes over the other.

Control flow gives us this ability to choose among outcomes based off what else is happening in the program.
